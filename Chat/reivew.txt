Sails.js Chat app

1.Install the password-hash in npm using npm install password-hash

About this project and techonology involved

1.As a beginner in sails.js, its very easy to understand which is MVC design pattern.
2.Sails.js has pretty much advantage over other frameworks like express, interms of speed.
3.Starting with generating the models and controllers to rendering a message model in backbone.
4.This app has 2 controllers and 2 models and one model hold data of user and other model hold the message.
5.The mainController has function for corresponding routes.
6.Next is creating a route so that it can handle the homepage and chat page with two handlers for login and signup page.
7.Creating a folder called main to hold two pages, index page will have login and signup form and other page is our chatbox.
8.Jquery handlers are written to handle the click event and send a ajax post request and on the success we will redirect user to chat page else if
  the ajax call fails we will alert the responseText from the mainController.
8.Password are hashed and stored in a session using a npm module called password-hash.
9.On the login we will verify the user password using hash-password function.
10.Using the backbone view extent, which will fetch collection of messages from messagemodel and populate messages everytime when a model is added which is much simpler than 
   than writing a jquery or javascript function for fetching everytime.
11.Using tha backbone sync function which will check for option where that is id and send an ajax request when fetch is called.
12.Next is callback function which has actual message, which is create or deleted or updated using msg.views that is http r.
13.At last we will extend the sailCollection with message model.
14.The one user message updates are showed to other user immediately in chatbox.

Login and Signup Form
 the index page which has login and signup form are styled using bootstrap and chat page which has chatbox is 
 my own written chatbox which is simply HTML and CSS.

Errors i found is 
1.findUser which is replaced as findOne in latest sails version
2.On socket.on callback the uri.split("/").pop(); is replace by view in new version that is all REST method are stored in view
